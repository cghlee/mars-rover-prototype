# Mars Rover Prototype

A personal C# mini-project to replicate remote control of a Rover deployed on the surface of Mars.

## How to Run

This program was written in C# 12, on an LTS release of the .NET 8 framework.

- Install the latest version of [.NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0).
- Install an IDE of your choice; [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) is recommended.
- Use the `git clone` command to clone the repository onto your local machine.
- Open the cloned repository's `.sln` file within your IDE, and run the program.

## Future Considerations

- Add additional program features.
- Provide `.exe` file to avoid self-compilation.
